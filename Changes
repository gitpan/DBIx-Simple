Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Simple.

Incompatible changes are marked with "!!".

1.21  Thu Apr 29 14:40 2004
        - Removed two nonsense entries from the changelog. $db->array and
          $db->hash do NOT reuse.

1.20  Tue Apr 27 11:15 2004
        - Almost a complete rewrite :)
        - $db->emulate_subqueries is now deprecated. Use a better database
          engine instead.
        - $db->omniholder is now deprecated. The omniholder will be constant.
        - $db->{success} is now deprecated. Use the return value of $db->query
          instead.
        - $db->{reason} is now deprecated. Use $db->error instead.
     !! - $db->{dbi} has been renamed. Use $db->dbh instead (not $db->{dbh}).
        - DBIx::Simple->error can now be used as a class method.
        - New: $db->last_insert_id.
        - New: $db->keep_statements and statement caching.
        - New: $db->dbh.
     !! - New: $db->lc_columns, enabled by default. Affects $result->columns,
          $result->hash, $result->hashes, and $result->map_hashes.
        - New: $result->columns.
        - New: $result->bind, $result->fetch, $result->into.
        - New: $result->func. (Suggested by Sean McMurray <smcmurray@cpan.org>)
        - New: $result->attr. (Suggested by Sean McMurray <smcmurray@cpan.org>)
        - $result->array now returns a copy instead of the same arrayref over
          and over. If you need maximum efficiency, use $result->fetch instead.
        - Removed dependency on Attribute::Property to fix bugs with
          $db->emulate_subqueries and $db->omniholder in Perl 5.8.x.
     !! - As a result, archaic property assignment style no longer works.
          Instead of "$foo->bar($new_value)", use "$foo->bar = $new_value".
        - Improved error reporting.
        - As a result, DBIx::Simple now depends on Data::Swap.
        - Moved examples to a separate document: DBIx::Simple::Examples.
        - More conditions in DESTROY methods, to handle random destruction
          order during global destruction better.
        - Rebuilt distribution with h2xs to get lib/ and t/.

1.11  Tue Mar 26 19:05 2003
        - Documentation updates.
     !! - list() now returns the *last* element in scalar context (was: first).
        - hashes() and arrays() now return array references in scalar context.
        - Migrated two properties to Attribute::Properties. (new dependency)
        - $VERSION++.

0.10  Thu Jan 9 10:03 2003
        - Documentation rewrite!
        - New: $db->error(). In an upcoming release, $db->{reason} will be
          removed.
        - New: $db->func().
        - Removed some unused variables.
        - prepare() and execute() are now wrapped in eval { } to rewrite
          filename and line number if you use RaiseError
        - $result->map_hashes(), $result->map_arrays() and $result->map() now
          return a list in list context. In scalar context, they still return
          a hash reference
        - Dummy objects in boolean context now evaluate to false, so you can
          write "$db->query(...) or die $db->error;" but still be able to write
          "$db->query(...)->something()".
        - Dummy object's methods now return an empty list in list context
          instead of undef. 
        - PrintError now defaults to 0

0.09  Sun Dec 8 5:59 2002
        - $dbh->disconnect() only if the object's still there. This works
          around perl bug #18951. Something is killing objects during (or just
          before) global destruction. This bug was first found by Gerard Oskamp
          <gerard-perl@tuxje.nl>.

0.08  Mon Dec 2 21:16 2002
        - Added $result->finish() method
        - The documentation was wrong: "undef $result" did nothing useful, as
          DBIx::Simple kept a copy internally, for garbage cleaning purposes.
          An in-between class DBIx::Simple::Statement was added to work around
          this.
        - $db->disconnect() now destroys active statements
        - When finish() or disconnect() is used, attempts to use the database
          connection or statement handle now result in a verbose error message.

0.07  Mon Sep 30 7:48 2002
        - Removed TraceLevel thing that caused DBI to output debugging info
        - Very minor documentation update (removed 2 characters)

0.06  Fri Sep 20 10:55 2002
        - Oops: forgot to update the README file; nothing serious

0.05  Thu Sep 19 14:32 2002
        - Added $db->begin_work
        - No longer expanding the (??) omniholder inside quoted SQL
        - Subquery emulation! Have subqueries in MySQL! YAY!
          (Not enabled by default. Use $db->esq(1) to enable)
        - This module now requires Perl >= 5.6

0.04  Tue Sep 17 15:46 2002
        - Documentation updates only

0.03  Thu Jun 13 09:50 2002
        - New: "(??)" and $db->omniholder() (like EZDBI's ??L placeholder)
        - Documentation updates
        - Code updates (now uses $_[0] directly for speed in many methods)
        - $result->list() in scalar context returns first value only

0.02  Sat Mar 30 14:00 2002
        - New: $db->commit() and rollback().
          Suggested by tradez (perlmonks.org)
        - New: $result->map_hashes(), map_arrays(), map().
          Suggested by mattr (perlmonks.org)
        - New: $result->flat(), a plural form of list()

0.01  Thu Mar 28 18:04 2002
        - Initial CPAN release
